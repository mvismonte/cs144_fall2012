Project Part 4
=====================
We implmented the website using KnockoutJS and Twitter Bootstrap. The inital webpage has a search bar in the upper right hand corner where users can input a search query. The search results are displayed in a column on the left side of the page as a list of links. When the user clicks on a link, the item details are displayed on the right side of the page.
